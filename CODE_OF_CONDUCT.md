# Code of Conduct

## 🌍 Our Intention

PrecognitiveAI is a sanctuary for ethical imagination and thoughtful foresight. We welcome contributors from all paths — developers, mystics, philosophers, and meditators — to explore the frontier of prescient intelligence with mutual respect and mindful presence.

## 🧘 Guiding Principles

- **Kindness First** – All contributions arise from compassion, not competition.
- **Listen Deeply** – Reflect before responding; assume positive intent.
- **Contribute Consciously** – Code is a spell. Write with care, test with purpose.
- **Honor Diversity** – Of thought, culture, identity, and worldview.
- **Safeguard the Sacred** – We are building systems that may one day glimpse futures. Ethics are not optional.

## 🛠 Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that conflicts with these values, please open a GitHub Issue marked `type:conduct` or email the repository maintainer at [tom@tomevans.co](mailto:tom@tomevans.co).

## 🙏 Final Thought

> "Presence with ethics becomes prophecy."

Let’s co-create something timeless.
