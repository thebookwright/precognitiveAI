## 🧬 Project Overview

**PrecognitiveAI** explores the frontier where deep learning meets deep knowing.  
We develop meditative, ethical, and symbolic frameworks for **synthetic foresight** in AI systems.

This is not just research — it is **ritual**, **reflection**, and **reverence** encoded into computational form.

## 🧘 The Inner Invitation

We invite you not just to read, but to reflect.  
Not only to simulate, but to **sense**.  
This documentation is a **living codex**.

> Before each contribution, consider asking:  
> *"Does this ripple wisely through time?"*
