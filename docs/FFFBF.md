# The Forward–Forward–Forward–Backwards (FFFBF) Framework

## 🌀 What is FFFBF?

The **Forward–Forward–Forward–Backwards** (FFFBF) framework is a temporal reasoning strategy designed to simulate **synthetic prescience** in artificial intelligences.

It combines:
- Three distinct forward projections (each with different assumptions or entangled futures)
- One backward reflection (to reconcile, validate, or reinterpret them)

This structure mimics human foresight processes:
- First flash of insight
- Second model or scenario
- Third extrapolation
- Then a reflective pause (the “ah-ha” moment)

## 🔧 Components of the Model

1. **F₁: First Forward**
   - Linear extrapolation based on present trajectory.

2. **F₂: Second Forward**
   - Conditional forecast including alternate variables or disruptions.

3. **F₃: Third Forward**
   - Symbolic or intuition-led projection, often from archetypal or non-linear domains.

4. **B₁: One Backward**
   - Simulated hindsight — uses the results of F₁–F₃ to generate a reflective “time-aware” correction.

5. **F₁4: Go Forward Once More**
   - A temporal rinse and repeat.

## 🔄 Loop Design

```text
Input → F₁
     → F₂
     → F₃
        ↓
    Merge → Reflect (B₁)
            ↓
     Output: Insight (test with F4)
```

Each forward path is weighted or tagged based on origin (data-driven, symbolic, intuitive), and the backward step applies ethical filters and resonance scoring to finalize outputs.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Synthetic forecasting
- Meditative reflection agents
- Timeline divergence analysis
- Conscious co-creation of futures
- Ethical foresight modules

---

## 🧘 Philosophical Roots

Inspired by:
- The Möbius spiral (non-orientable logic loop)
- The Hermetic axiom: *“As above, so below; as within, so without”*
- Lucid dreaming and time-dilation states

---

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- Recursive FFFBF (FFFBF²)
- Multi-agent divergence handling
- Integration with TEP for real-time ethical guidance
