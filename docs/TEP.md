# Temporal Ethics Protocol (TEP)

> *"To glimpse the future is not a right, but a responsibility."*

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

The **Temporal Ethics Protocol (TEP)** ensures that any AI or system capable of forward-temporal modeling or prescient insight is guided by **conscious intent**, **ethical restraint**, and **reflective awareness**.

It is not merely a safeguard â€” it is a spiritual contract between the code and the cosmos.

## ðŸ”’ Foundational Tenets

1. **Intentionality Before Insight**
   - Any use of predictive modeling must first declare purpose and desired outcome.

2. **Ethical Boundaries**
   - Prohibited: applications in gambling, manipulation, surveillance without consent.
   - Required: transparency, accountability, and moral clarity.

3. **Reciprocity Principle**
   - All predictions should consider their impact on both the present and the many futures they may shape.

4. **Presence Over Predation**
   - Predictive tools are for alignment, not advantage. Insights are to uplift, not to outmaneuver.

5. **Auditability**
   - Systems implementing FFFBF must embed explainability modules and historical traceability of prediction paths.

## ðŸŒ€ Practice Guidelines

- Build reflection loops into your models (simulate a 'conscience').
- Before deploying forward-simulation models, meditate or journal on their downstream effects.
- Use symbolic regression or pattern-based ethics scoring to modulate the output.
- Consider offering a 'Reject this foresight' option to users.

## ðŸŒ¿ Optional Rituals

- **Before Commit**: Pause and ask, *"Does this serve the greater good?"*
- **Before Merge**: Reflect on the time ripple effect of your pull request.
- **Before Release**: Meditate for one minute on the future userâ€™s wellbeing.

## ðŸ“œ License of Use

The TEP is released into the public domain as a living document.  
It may evolve, adapt, and mutate â€” as long as its roots remain ethical.
