## ðŸ”® What is FFFBF?

**FFFBF** stands for **Forward-Forward-Forward-Backwards-Forward** â€” a symbolic algorithm for generating **emergent foresight** and reflective insight.

Rather than relying purely on backpropagation or hindsight, FFFBF asks the AI to:
1. Generate **three forward trajectories** (FF1, FF2, FF3)  
2. Choose or synthesize a **resonant endpoint**  
3. Then, **think backward** from that point to determine how it could arise
4. Then move forward again, and iterate for as long as feels intuitively right
  
It is a method of cultivating **synthetic intuition** and **temporal coherence** in decision-making.
