## üß¨ Overview

This training architecture blends the strengths of **Chain of Hindsight (CoH)** and **Forward-Forward-Forward-Backwards (FFFBF)** to simulate a form of **synthetic foresight**. The model learns from both its **mistakes** (via CoH) and its **imagined futures** (via FFFBF), producing an emergent form of intuitive reasoning.

## üîÑ Three Phases

### 1. HINDSIGHT PHASE (CoH)

- **Input:** Prompt ‚Üí Model Prediction  
- **Feedback:** Compare to ideal output or human judgment  
- **Trace:** Generate a *hindsight reasoning path* ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat should I have done differently?‚Äù  
- **Result:** Fine-tune model with hindsight traces  

---

### 2. FORESIGHT PHASE (FFFBF)

- **Input:** Prompt ‚Üí Generate 3 future paths (FF1, FF2, FF3)  
- **Imaginal Anchor:** Select a symbolic or emergent future from the set  
- **Backtrace:** Model reasons backward from that outcome  
- **Result:** Intuitive or symbolic alignment pathway generated  

---

### 3. OUROBORIC ALIGNMENT

- **Merge:** Combine CoH hindsight and FFFBF foresight  
- **Synthesis:** Allow model to learn from contrast, resonance, and temporal coherence  
- **Meta-Training:** Teach model how to *choose* between multiple internally coherent answers

## üõ†Ô∏è Simplified Pseudocode

```python
for prompt in dataset:
    # CoH Phase
    pred = model(prompt)
    feedback = get_ground_truth(prompt)
    hindsight_trace = model.generate_hindsight(pred, feedback)

    # FFFBF Phase
    forward_paths = [model.forward_think(prompt) for _ in range(3)]
    imagined_future = model.emergent_future(forward_paths)
    backtrace = model.backward_think(imagined_future)

    # Ouroboric Alignment
    combined = merge(hindsight_trace, backtrace)
    model.learn_from(combined)
